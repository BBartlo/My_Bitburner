             * by harnessing the power of the n00dles.
    
    Source-File 1: Source Genesis - Level 3 / 3
        This Source-File lets the player start with 32GB of RAM on his/her home computer.

            Level 1: 16%
            Level 2: 24%
            Level 3: 28%

    Source-File 2: Rise of the Underworld - Level 1 / 3
        This Source-File allows you to form gangs in other BitNodes once your karma decreases to a certain value. It also increases the player's crime success rate, crime money, and charisma multipliers by:
            Level 1: 24%
            Level 2: 36%
            Level 3: 42%

    Source-File 4: The Singularity - Level 3 / 3
        This Source-File lets you access and use the Singularity Functions in every BitNode. Every level of this Source-File reduces the RAM cost of Singularity functions:
            Level 1: 16x
            Level 2: 4x
            Level 3: 1x

    Source-File 5: Artificial Intelligence - Level 3 / 3

        Higher Intelligence levels will boost your production for many actions in the game. In addition, this Source-File will unlock: 
            The getBitNodeMultipliers() Netscript function
            Permanent access to Formulas.exe
            Access to BitNode multiplier information on the Stats page

                Level 2: 12%
                Level 3: 14%
